		CONTRACT</b> <br> <br> Both parties agree that browsing the

	you have selected the item you intend to purchase, chosen your
	preferred payment method, proceeded to the checkout and completed the
	checkout process. <br> <br> Both parties agree that the

	phone or by email to confirm that the order has been placed online.
	Your offer is only accepted when we dispatch the product to you and
	inform you either by email or by phone of the dispatch of your ordered
	product. <br> <br> Before your order is confirmed, you may be
	asked to provide additional verifications or information, including but
	not limited to phone number and address, before we accept the order. <br>

	accurate pricing information on the Site to our users; however, errors
	may still occur, such as cases when the price of an item is not
	displayed correctly on the website. As such, we reserve the right to
	refuse or cancel any order. In the event that an item is mispriced, we
	may, at our own discretion, either contact you for instructions or
	cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. <br> <br>
	We shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or
	not the order has been confirmed and your credit/debit card charged. In
	the event that we are unable to provide the services, we will inform
	you of this as soon as possible. A full refund will be given where you
	have already paid for the products. <br> <br> <b>USE OF
		VOUCHER CODES</b> <br> <br> Our Site accepts the use of voucher
	codes for orders placed online. The marketing voucher codes which are
	accepted on our Site entitle you at the time of ordering a product to a
	saving on the order being placed on our Site. Vouchers may also be
	issued to customers in exchange for advance payments made to us via
	transfer to our bank accounts for products intended to be purchased on
	the Site. <br> <br> Our voucher codes may not be exchanged
	for cash. With the exception of vouchers issued in accordance with our

	neither are we involved in the actual sale transaction between the
	buyers and sellers on the Airtel Marketplace. <br> <br> The
	buyer and seller agree that we would be held free from any liability in
	contract, pre-contract or other representations in tort, for all
	transactions conducted on the Airtel Marketplace. <br> <br> <b>DELIVERY</b>
	<br> <br> This Site is only for delivery of products to
	customers within Nigeria. We make every effort to deliver goods within
	the estimated timescales set out on our Site; however delays are
	occasionally inevitable due to unforeseen factors. We shall be under no
	liability for any delay or failure to deliver the products within the
	estimated timescales where they did not occur due to our fault or
	negligence. <br> <br> You agree not to hold the seller liable
	for any delay or failure to deliver products or otherwise perform any
	obligation as specified in these Terms and Conditions of Sale if the
	same is wholly or partly caused whether directly or indirectly by
	circumstances beyond our reasonable control. <br> <br>
